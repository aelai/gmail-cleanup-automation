## Cleanup rules for the Gmail automation workflow.
##
# Each rule contains a name, a Gmail search query, and an action.  The
# query syntax follows the same format used in the Gmail web interface.
# See https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190 for details on
# supported operators.  When action is `review` a label will be applied
# instead of deleting the message.  When action is `delete` the message
# will be moved to Trash.
#
# Labels specified in review rules must already exist in your Gmail
# account or be created by the workflow ahead of time.
